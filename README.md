Parkinsons Disease Prediction

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a person has Parkinson's Disease based on various biomedical features.

1.Built a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify individuals as Parkinson's positive or negative using biomedical voice measurements.

2.Preprocessed the dataset, standardized features, and trained the SVM classifier achieving high accuracy on both training and testing data.

3.Developed a predictive system to determine Parkinson's status based on input features, demonstrating practical applications in early detection.
