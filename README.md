Parkinsons Disease

Built a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify individuals as Parkinson's positive or negative using biomedical voice measurements.

Preprocessed the dataset, standardized features, and trained the SVM classifier achieving high accuracy on both training and testing data.

Developed a predictive system to determine Parkinson's status based on input features, demonstrating practical applications in early detection.
